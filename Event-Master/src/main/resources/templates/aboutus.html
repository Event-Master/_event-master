          <p>I’m a high school dropout from Hilo, Hawaii and a veteran of the Marine Corps, tug boats, kitchens, sales and bee keeping. Most recently I left my position as the production manager for a single malt whiskey distillery.
          <br />The lockdown showed the fragility of my industry and forced me to consider own position within it, so now I’m pursuing a career in Software Development for what I plan to be my last career change.</p>

            <p>I am an 11 year veteran of the United States Army. I've spent the last 6 years as Army Aviator, and the last two of those years as an Instructor Pilot for the CH-47F Chinook Helicopter. 
                I decided to become a Software Developer because it's a field that I have had very limited knowledge on yet always found it enticing. I love to learn new things, be challenged, see growth and progress in myself, work in a team environment, and have a final product that showcases a specific challenge when completed. Software Development, as I have realized, fits that to the T.
                I truly enjoy collaborating with other people toward a common goal and value the idea of using each others strengths together to build a team.
                I find myself thriving in small group settings, singularly focused, with an achievable goal that everyone can share in reaching, and truly feeling the rewards of that hard work and dedication.  
                The time I have spent in the military has allowed me to develop a sense of grit and "stick-with-It-ness" that follows me into every aspect of my life; especially when it comes to challenges in the Tech industry. To me, the desired outcome of a given project or challenge IS the source of motivation, and my own internal drive is fueled by that motivation. 
                I am full of ambition and drive. I am creative. I am a leader, but also a follower. I am supportive, and I do not shy away from a challenge. I am very optimistic about the future, and look forward to the next step in my journey. </p>
